			Intro Paragraphs
		</h1>

		<p class="paragraph-item">
			Hi! My name is Lucas, I'm a Senior at NYU Tandon School of Engineering, studying Computer Science and Math. 
			I am from Summit NJ, and in my spare time I like to cook, and lately I have been getting into Muay Thai (Thai kick-boxing). 
			I want to give a quick shoutout and thank you to Dr. Peter Depasquale for properly introducing me to Computer Science, and 
			for helping me along this path.<br>
			I currently work as a Computer Science Teaching Assistant, helping with the python course at NYU Tandon.

			My Interests
		</h1>

		<p class="paragraph-item">
			Within Computer Science, my interests have pretty significant range, and I have
			been working on projects that show my proficiency in many areas. I do occasionally
			enjoy dabbling in front end web development, but given the chance I would like to 
			work with lower level languages like C for either embedded programs, or just general
			high performance algorithms (which you can see down below)
		</p>

			Open Source Contribution
		</h1>

		<p class="paragraph-item">
			In the time I haven't spent at an internship (if you are an employer reading this you
			have a chance to change that) I have been working on open source contribution. I am
			currently a listed contributor to the Javascript math library but I plan on expanding
			my effort as time goes. My work has been on documentation, as well as developing core functionalities
			and appropriate test cases. <br>

			Additionally I have been contributing to repositories owned by NYU in my capacity as a Teaching Assistant
			in order to better improve the educational experience of other students.

			vscode/discord interface
		</h1>

		<p class="paragraph-item">
			This project is a Visual Studio Code extension that integrates with Discord via a bot, which allows a 
			person to read and send messages to a given channel through the bot. It utilizes the client machine as
			a host, and provides an interface similar in style to Github Copilot. The tech stack used involved: 
			Javascript, Node.js, VS Code Webview Api, Discord.js, and HTML/CSS.

			Forex arbitrage trading bot via AWS
		</h1>
		<p class="paragraph-item">
			The Forex Arbitrage Trading Bot is an advanced system designed to exploit price discrepancies across various forex markets, aiming to generate profits through low-latency trading. The bot continuously monitors multiple forex exchanges, identifies arbitrage opportunities, and executes trades in real-time with minimal latency. 
			Leveraging the power of AWS, the system ensures high availability and scalability, capable of handling the intense computational requirements of high-frequency trading.

			Tuned Linux Kernel for Machine Learning
		</h1>
		<p class="paragraph-item">
			The Tuned Linux Kernel for Machine Learning is a custom-built Linux kernel optimized for AI and machine learning workloads. This project involves configuring and fine-tuning kernel parameters to enhance performance, reduce latency, and improve resource management for ML applications. The optimized kernel provides a robust and efficient environment for running intensive machine learning tasks on both local machines and cloud-based platforms like AWS.

			Brawlr(just for fun please don't download)
		</h1>
		<p class="paragraph-item">
			Brawlr is a unique social networking app designed for individuals interested in organizing and participating in combat sports and fighting matches. 
			Similar to Tinder, users can swipe through profiles, but instead of dates, they are looking for opponents. 
			The app facilitates match-making, scheduling, and communication between fighters, providing a platform for both amateur and professional fighters to connect and arrange bouts.

			NYU Databases Project
		</h1>
		<p class="paragraph-item">
			This was a full stack web development project used in order to model a corrections 
			facility, involving use of html/css/python(flask). The database was locally hosted for 
			demonstration purposes. <br>

			It involved thorough logging of usage and access to the database, as well as meaningful
			protection against SQL injection. <br>

			If I was given more time on that project, I would have appreciated the chance to further expand
			security, clean up the front end a bit more, and possibly consider AWS hosting.
